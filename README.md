### Prediction of documents' relevance and their classification
This is a project of Advanced Machine Learning subject. The data analysed comes from the company BIP Solutions Ltd. One issue they have is maintaining data quality and normalising all the incoming documents so that they share the same meta data. Another issue they have is trying to predict which tenders/documents are relevant to their user. The project addresses two problems:

- A binary classification problem where you need to predict whether the interaction with a document lead to it being considered relevant or not relevant. Notebook: https://github.com/aneetxeandia/MSc-Data-Analytics-Projects/blob/70724e41d86a5a6c5743bf87ad53e88cceaba175/Relevance.ipynb
- A multi classification problem where you need to predict from the text of the document what industry the document is related to. Notebook: https://github.com/aneetxeandia/MSc-Data-Analytics-Projects/blob/70724e41d86a5a6c5743bf87ad53e88cceaba175/Classification.ipynb

### Prediction of popularity/genre of spotify songs
This is a project of the Fundamentals of Machine Learning subject. The data analysed comes from Spotify and captures various attributes about songs. The project adresses two problems:

- A regression problem which aims to predict the populariity score of a song.
- A classification problem which aims to predict the top genre that a song belongs to

The following algorithms have been attempted to adress the problem: Random Forest, Decision Tree, Linear Support Vector Machine, Polynomial Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression and Ensembled methods
