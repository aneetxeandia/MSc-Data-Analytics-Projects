### Prediction of popularity/genre of spotify songs
The data analysed comes from Spotify and captures various attributes about songs and includes a popularity score. 
The project adresses two problems:

-A regression problem which aims to predict the populariity score of a song.

-A classification problem which aims to predict the top genre that a song belongs to

The following algorithms have been attempted to adress the problem: Random Forest, Decision Tree, Linear Support Vector Machine, Polynomial Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression and Ensembled methods
